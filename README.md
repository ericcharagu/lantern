TODO:
1.  [ ] Check whatasapp connectivity and each request.
2. [ ] Send the daily report at 5am to the number.Define the scope as : How many people were spotted between 10 and 4:50am. 

3.  [ ] Create logging for each user's case. For instance:logging the reports generated for the 3 VIP's and the normal user. 
4.  [ ] What capabilities are present for the normal user?: Booking? Inquiry? Shared calendar? Guide people into booking. ADDED after security is complete?
5.  [ ] A request form for the whats-app number. Investigate the associated costs for it. Table it and send. Per request? Included in the monthly payment? Can be given after the web version is launched. 
6. [ ] Ensure camera connections(visually?) work for each based on their current operations.
7. [ ] Refine the db entries for the data. Focus on : 
        1. individual perfomance - how many people were trackked and at what time.
8. [ ] Look at the benefits of using libs to process the batch result data e.g by timestamp and only  store the hourly? or simply just store the results for each frame?-> Cons: This means that the data will grow by the second. 
                                 Alt: store only half-hour data(30 min)

9. [ ]
